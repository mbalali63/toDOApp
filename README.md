# ToDo List
## Introduction
This project is defined to practice React and its implementation. So, initially I will define the components
that will be required. then each component will be created and styled.
The outline of the app is prepared using Figma. It can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/E9ALdAiWkz7cwGmUM8ycaY/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=2PlfZoH6orhQZ7tq-0). The following image illustrates the initial design screenshot, in FIGMA.

## Components
Here the list of components is provided:
1. Header
2. Search bar
   1. Search input
   2. Add button
3. Tasks List   
4. Footer
   1. Add button
   2. Search Icon
   3. Status Caption
   4. Filters (All, Active, Completed)

## Challenges
These are the main challenges I face during the development:
1. Saving and updating tasks data 
   To resolve this problem, considering that I am not ready to work with backend tools,
   I will use a JSON array
   at the moment, I am not sure that during the executation of the session, this array will
   retain or not.
